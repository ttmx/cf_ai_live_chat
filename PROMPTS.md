## LLM Code assistance
This project had a small chunk of it's code written using GitHub Copilot's tab completion, and no code written using Agent mode or similar as I wanted to actually learn the technologies I hadn't used before myself.
Agent mode was used to write the github actions workflow as I have written a lot of those before.


# Prompts
- pls add CI using github actions so I only have to provide it with a CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN secret
